                That represents an enormous opportunity to create culturally widespread impact, but roughly 65% of believers are disengaged from their work and view it as separate from their faith. This reveals that most Christians don’t realize that work was designed by God as a partnered effort toward restoring the world to its original  goodness. But when people do realize that faith and work are designed by God to be integrated, work becomes an act of worship, and everything changes – lives, families, and entire.

            Hugh has lived in 3 global cities for 40 years and has experienced  first-hand the major problems cities have. In his book “Why God Made  Cities”, Timothy Keller says, “If sin has twisted the city as it’s  twisted the family, and God invented the city, then we don’t abandon it – we build it.” He has experienced twisted problems of a city that can  feel overwhelming and beyond repair. He has also experienced city  leaders from different spheres of society successfully work together to  address these problems when their collaborative efforts reflect a  culture of love for one another. He believes in Isaiah 58:12: “You’ll be known as those who can fix anything, restore old ruins, rebuild and  renovate, make the community livable again.”

He continues to lead our educational work and has recently begun to serve  as Chief Culture Officer.
